Very very simple plugin which provides only one command:

:SCSSA

To use it, select some lines containing CSS properties, then use the command.
It will align them. That's all :-)

If you want to be sure having the last version of this plugin, check my github repository (in case of I forgot to update here): 
https://github.com/webastien/vim/blob/master/vim/plugin/SCSSA.vim 

On github, you will also find my VIm configuration. Feel free to extract parts of code you need from my sources. 
This could be better but I use those for my daily works without problems and it will be improved over the time. 
I always miss time to refactor and clean the code, so if you want to help, you're welcome ;-)
